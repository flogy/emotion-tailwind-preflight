**ðŸ’Ž Merge the shiny TailwindCSS base styles into your CSS-in-JS project!**

You like the [base styles](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-base-styles) from [TailwindCSS library](https://tailwindcss.com/)? But you also want to use the [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) CSS-in-JS library? Then this library is for you.

The *emotion-tailwind-preflight* library contains the latest base styles from TailwindCSS, which they call **Preflight**.

The Preflight CSS is pulled from [TailwindCSS library](https://tailwindcss.com/) and parsed into emotion ready format.

## What do the base styles do

The TailwindCSS base styles are an opinionated set of CSS styles to smooth over cross-browser inconsistencies. They for example remove all default margins. Check out the [TailwindCSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight/) to see all detailed configurations.
